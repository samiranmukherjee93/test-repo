Overview
Using NHANES data, we aim to predict the determinants of liver fibrosis (using the publically available fibroscan data). 
In addition, we will also learn to train a machine learning model to identify variables that can best predict the occurence of 
fibrosis. 

Introduction
Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)  is prevalent in 30% of the US population. It is strongly associated with the 
presence of co-morbid metabolic risk factors like obesity, type 2 DM, hypertension and hyperlipidemia. Given that 1% patients will end up 
developing liver cirrhosis (fibroscan liver stiffness cut off >14.6), it is imperative to identify preventable independent 
variables that may influence the occurence of the same.
